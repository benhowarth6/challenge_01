# Challenge 1 - Horiseon Website

## Description

This project is a website for Horiseon, a social solution services company. The website was created to highlight companies services. We have refactored this codebase to improve efficiency and accessibility. During the refactoring I've learnt to use semantic HTML elements to structure the page correctly.
